# ♻️ Wewantwaste Skip Selector Redesign – React + Tailwind CSS

Dear REMWaste HR and Resh C.,

Thank you sincerely for giving me the opportunity to demonstrate my frontend development skills through this challenge.

This project is a **complete redesign** of the *"Choose Your Skip Size"* page from [wewantwaste.co.uk](https://wewantwaste.co.uk), developed using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. The goal was to create a visually refreshed, responsive, and accessible interface while preserving all original functionality.
